# This is a public section of my research on perciever models for intensive care unit data 

This model makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/perceiver-pytorch">Lucidrains Pytorch Perceiver</a>, and inherits classes from OATMls' <a href="https://github.com/OATML/non-parametric-transformers">Non Parametric Transformers</a>



**files**

the code to deploy the model with hyperparameters can be found in perceiver_baseline_test.py
z_cifar_npt_files contains modules for the main script
